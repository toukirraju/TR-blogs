## Description 
TR blog post app uses Redux for state management and allows users to view, save, and filter blog posts based on criteria such as date and popularity. Users can also view details of individual blog posts, save them for later, and see related posts based on tags. The app uses React Router for routing and has a responsive design.


## Features


âœ“ Display blogs in the order they are received from    the API.

âœ“ Implement sorting functionality to filter blogs by "Newest" or "Most Liked".

âœ“ Allow users to like blogs, and the number of likes will increase without authentication.

âœ“ Implement a "Saved" menu that displays the saved blogs.

âœ“ Clicking on a blog's title or thumbnail will take the user to the Details page using 'react-router-dom'.

âœ“ Allow users to save blogs by clicking the "Save" button on the Details page, which will change the text to "Saved" and the color to blue.

âœ“ Display related blogs based on tags in the "Related Blogs" section on the Details page.

âœ“ Do not include the current blog post in the "Related Blogs" list.
